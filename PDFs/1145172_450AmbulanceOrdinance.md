grant  a  license  to  an  ambulance  operator,  if  the Director finds  that  adherence  to  such  procedure(s)  or 
condition(s) will either prevent or delay the securing by the county of cost-effective and efficient emergency 
ambulance services which the Director has determined are immediately needed to serve county residents. 
As a requirement to the waiver of any such procedure or condition, however, either a county contract for 
the provision of emergency ambulance services to county residents must be executed by the operator and 
by the Board or the Director must find that the ambulance operator provides special events services only.

county with respect to said administrative fine, and the fine shall be due and payable to the Director 
within thirty (30) calendar days following service of the notice of administrative fine. 
 
D. The Director shall serve a notice of administrative fine by either of the following methods: 
 
1. By  personal  delivery  to  the  operator  or  operator's  employee  or  agent.  Service  shall  be  deemed 
effective at the time of the personal delivery; or 
 
2. By first class mail to operator at operator's place of business. Service shall be deemed effective 
five (5) calendar days after the date of mailing. 
 
E. Payment  of  the  administrative  fine  shall  not  excuse  the  operator  from  correcting  the  violation  when 
required by the Director. 
 
(Ord. 2011-0031 § 13, 2011.) 
 
7.16.128 Request for administrative hearing. 
 
A. Any operator served with a notice of administrative fine may request an administrative hearing before 
a hearing officer to contest the imposition and/or amount of the administrative fine. The request must 
be in writing and be filed with the local EMS agency Director within ten (10) calendar days following 
service of the notice of administrative fine and shall include a statement indicating the basis on which 
the operator contests the imposition of the administrative fine, together with any evidence the operator 
would like the hearing officer to consider. 
 
B. The  written  request  for  administrative  hearing  must  be  accompanied  by  a  deposit  equal  to  the  full 
amount of the administrative fine(s) specified in the notice of administrative fine. Failure to deposit this 
amount  concurrently  with  the  request  for  administrative  hearing  shall  constitute  a  waiver  of  the 

SUBJECT: LOS ANGELES COUNTY CODE, TITLE 7, 
 BUSINESS LICENSES, DIVISION 2 
 CHAPTER 7.16 AMBULANCES REFERENCE NO. 450 
 
PAGE 15 OF 23 
operator's  entitlement  to  the  administrative  hearing.  The  hearing  request  and  fee  deposit  shall  be 
deemed filed on the date received by the local EMS agency. 
 
C. After receiving a timely hearing request and the full amount of fine deposit, the local EMS agency shall 
schedule an administrative hearing. The operator shall be given not less than ten (10) calendar days 
prior written  notice of the  date, time, and  location  of the administrative hearing  and the name  of the 
hearing officer who will conduct the administrative hearing.

of the hearing date upon written request and a showing of good cause. The request must be received 
by  the  hearing  officer  at  least  two  (2)  business  days  prior  to  the  hearing.  In  no  event  shall  the 
continuance be longer than forty-five (45) calendar days from the originally scheduled hearing date. 
 
C. At  the  hearing,  the  operator  shall  have  the  opportunity  to  present  evidence  relevant  to  the  hearing 
officer's determination of the matter. The failure of the operator to appear at the administrative hearing 
shall constitute an abandonment of the hearing request and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies 
to  judicially  challenge  the  imposition  of  the  administrative  fine.  If  the  administrative  hearing  is 
abandoned, the issuing department shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request. 
 
D. The  notice  of  violation,  notice  of  administrative  fine,  and  any  other  reports  prepared  by  or  for  the 
enforcement  officer  concerning the code violation, shall  be accepted  by the hearing officer  as prima 
facie evidence of the code violation and the facts stated in those documents. 
 
E. After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing and within ten (10) calendar 
days after  the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision that confirms or 
cancels the administrative fine. The written decision shall include a statement of the reasons for the 
decision and shall be served personally or by first-class mail. The hearing officer's written decision shall 
constitute the final administrative decision of the county. 
 
F. If the hearing confirms the imposition of the full amount of the administrative fine, the local EMS agency 
shall keep the funds deposited with the hearing request. 
 
G. If  the  hearing  officer  cancels  the  administrative  fine,  the  local  EMS  agency  shall  refund  the  entire 
amount of the funds deposited with the hearing request to the operator within twenty (20) calendar days 
from the date of the written decision. 
 
(Ord. 2011-0031 § 15, 2011.)

The Department of Health Services shall not issue an ambulance operator's license to any privately owned 
emergency hospital, any privately owned urgent care center, or any private hospital, nonprofit hospital, or 
physician group. 
 
The Director of  the Department  of Health Services  may  make  individual  exceptions  to  this  limitation  if  a 
waiver of the provision is requested. Granting of a request for waiver would be based on a finding that the 
public convenience and necessity requires issuance of the ambulance operator's license.

The total charges shall be the sum of the appropriate base rate plus the mileage rate applied to the distance 
actually traveled, plus the time rate applied to requested waiting or standby time, plus any special charges 
which  apply.  Ground  ambulance  operators  who  choose  to  use  computer-based  mileage  calculations  to 
provide consistency in mileage billing in lieu of the distance recorded by the ambulance vehicle driver, shall 
request authorization from the local EMS agency prior to implementation of such a program. As part of the 
authorization process, the operator shall provide the local EMS agency with a quality assurance program 
that details the operator's plan for periodic reviews of both the computer mileage assisted calculations and 
the data entry process to insure that the patient is not overcharged. The local EMS agency will approve or 
reject  use  of  a  computer-based  mileage  calculation  program  within  30  days  of  receipt  of  a  request  for 
approval.  All  rates,  including  computer-based  mileage  charges,  are  to be  computed  from  the  time  the 
ground ambulance arrives  for  hire until the ground ambulance is discharged by the  patient or  his or  her 
authorized representative.

7.16.340 Modification of rates. 
The maximum rates chargeable to the general public as set forth in Sections 7.16.280 and 7.16.310 of this 
chapter shall be adjusted effective July 1, 1992, and on July 1st of each year thereafter, to reflect changes 
in the value of the dollar. For each of the one-year periods respectively beginning July 1, 1992 and July 1, 
1993, such adjustments shall be made by multiplying the base amounts by the percentage change in the 
transportation portion of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled 
and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day of the prior 
month  of  February.  Beginning  July  1,  1994,  and  on  each  July  1  thereafter,  such  adjustments  shall  be 
determined by multiplying the base amounts by the average of the percentage changes of the transportation 
portion and of the medical portion of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, Western Region, 
as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day 
of the prior month of February. Beginning July 1, 2017, and on every July 1 thereafter, such adjustments 
shall be determined by multiplying seventy-five (75) percent of the base amounts by the percentage change 
of  the  minimum  wage  change  in  Los  Angeles  County  as  defined  in  County  Code  Section  8.100.040 – 
Minimum Wage and by multiplying twenty-five (25) percent of the base amounts by the percentage change 
of the Medical Care line item of the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Customers, Western Region, as 
compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending with the last day 
of the prior month of February, except for the following changes: Registered Nurse/Respiratory Therapist 
per hour after the first three (3) hours adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the current charge by 
the percentage change of the minimum wage change in Los Angeles County as defined in County Code 
Section 8.100.040 – Minimum Wage: mileage  adjustment shall be determined  by multiplying the current 
charge for the percentage change of the transportation line item of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban 
Customers, Western Region, as compiled as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for 
the  12-month  period  ending  with  the  last  day  of  the  prior  month  of  February:  and  Oxygen,  Disposable 
Medical Supplies, and a Ventilator adjustment shall be determined by multiplying the current charges by 
the percentage change of the Medical Care line item of the Consumer Price Index for all of the Customers, 
Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the 12-month period ending 
with the last day of the prior month of February. Beginning July 1, 2024, and on every July 1 thereafter, 
such adjustments shall be determined by multiplying seventy-five (75) percent of the base amounts by the 
percentage change of the minimum wage change in Los Angeles County as defined in County Code Section 
8.100.040 – Minimum  Wage, or  by  two  percent, whichever  is  higher,  and by multiplying twenty-five (25) 
percent  of  the  base  amounts  by  the  percentage  change  of  the  Medical  Care  line  item  of  the  Consumer 
Price Index for all Urban Consumers, Western Region, as compiled and reported by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics for  the 12-month  period ending with the  last day of the prior  month  of  February. The result so 
determined shall be rounded to the nearest whole number and added or subtracted, as appropriate, to the 
rate. The Director of the department of health services shall initiate implementation of these rate changes 
by notifying in writing each licensed private ambulance operator in Los Angeles County thereof, and any

calendar month the maximum response times defined in Section 7.16.050 of this chapter. The Director of 
the Department of Health Services may waive in writing one or more of these response time requirements 
for any operator for a prescribed period. In determining whether to grant any such waiver, the Director must 
find that one or more of the following geographical or other special or unusual conditions for the area for 
which the waiver is sought prevented the operator from satisfying the response time requirement(s): 
A. Physical isolation of the area; 
 
B. Topographical conditions; 
 
C. Road conditions; 
 
D. Adverse weather conditions. 
 
E. Multiple Casualty Response when at least one (1) other unit has previously been dispatched and arrived
