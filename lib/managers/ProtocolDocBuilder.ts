Chief Complaint: [Patient's own words about pain/injury]

Entrapment Details:
- Duration: [X] minutes (from [TIME] to [TIME])
- Body parts involved: [Specific anatomy - e.g., "circumferential compression of left thigh and pelvis"]
- Type of compression: [Circumferential / One-directional]
- Weight/object: [What was crushing the patient]

History: [Allergies, medications, past medical history if obtained]

**OBJECTIVE:**

Initial Vitals: BP [X/X], HR [X], RR [X], SpO2 [X]%, GCS [X]

Crush Syndrome Risk Assessment (ALL 3 criteria):
1. Circumferential compression: [YES / NO]
2. Large muscle group involved: [YES - specify which / NO]
3. Entrapment â‰¥1 hour: [YES - X minutes / NO]
Risk Determination: [HIGH RISK / NO RISK]

Physical Exam:
- Crushed area: [Describe injury - swelling, deformity, open wounds]
- Neurovascular:
  * Distal pulses: [Present/Absent/Diminished - specify which pulse]
  * Sensation: [Intact/Decreased/Absent]
  * Motor: [Can/Cannot move digits, describe]
  * Compartment: [Soft/Tense, painful with passive stretch yes/no]
- Skin: [Color, temperature, wounds]

ECG: [MUST be specific if abnormal]
- Rhythm: [Sinus/Other]
- Rate: [X]
- Peaked T-waves: [YES in leads ____ / NO]
- P-waves: [Present / Absent]
- QRS width: [0.XX seconds, Normal <0.12]
- Interpretation: [Normal / Hyperkalemia suspected]

**ASSESSMENT:**

Working Impression: Traumatic Injury (TRMA) - Crush Injury/Syndrome
Protocol: TP 1242
[If pediatric: TP 1242-P]

Crush Syndrome Risk: [HIGH / LOW] based on 3-criteria assessment above.
[If high risk: Patient meets all criteria - aggressive treatment per protocol indicated]

Differential considerations:
- Rhabdomyolysis
- Hyperkalemia
- Compartment syndrome
- Hemorrhagic shock
- [Other injuries identified]

**PLAN:**

Timeline of Care:
[TIME] - Scene arrival, patient assessment
[TIME] - Vascular access established [site, size]
[TIME] - Cardiac monitoring initiated
[TIME] - Normal Saline 1L IV rapid infusion initiated
[TIME] - Assessed for pulmonary edema after 250mL (clear lungs, no distress)
[TIME] - Assessed after 500mL (clear)
[TIME] - First liter complete, reassessed (clear)
[TIME] - Second liter Normal Saline initiated
[TIME] - [If crush syndrome risk] Medications administered 5 minutes pre-extrication:
        * Calcium Chloride 1g (10mL) IV slow push
        * Flushed IV line with 10mL Normal Saline
        * Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq (50mL) IV slow push
        * Albuterol 5mg (6mL) via mask nebulizer x2 doses (total 10mg)
[TIME] - Patient extricated
[TIME] - Post-extrication vitals: BP [X/X], HR [X], RR [X], SpO2 [X]%
[TIME] - ECG reassessed: [Response to medications if given]
[TIME] - Base Hospital contact: [Hospital name, physician name]
        Orders received: [Specify any additional orders]
[TIME] - Transport initiated to [FACILITY NAME - Trauma Center Level I/II]
[TIME] - Ongoing continuous albuterol nebulization
[TIME] - Pain management: [If given - medication, dose, route, response]
[TIME] - Arrival at receiving facility, report to [RN/MD name]

Medications Administered:
- Normal Saline: [Total volume]mL IV, [timing relative to extrication]
- [If given] Calcium Chloride 1g IV push at [TIME], response: [ECG changes, vital signs]
- [If given] Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq IV push at [TIME], response: [ECG changes]
- [If given] Albuterol 10mg neb at [TIME], ongoing continuous
- [If given] Pain meds: [Medication] [dose] [route] at [TIME], response: [pain scale improvement]

Response to Treatment:
- Vital signs: [Trend - improved/stable/worsened]
- ECG: [If abnormal initially - improved/unchanged]
- Neurovascular: [Improved/unchanged/worsened]
- Mental status: [Alert/confused/GCS]
- Urine output: [If catheter - volume, color - dark/tea-colored indicates myoglobinuria]

Transport:
- Destination: [FACILITY] - Trauma Center Level I/II [with nephrology/dialysis capability]
- Mode: Code 3 [or Code 2]
- Criteria: [SBP <90 / Neurovascular compromise / Crush syndrome risk / Other Ref 506 criteria]
- Pre-notification: [Trauma Center notified at TIME, estimated arrival TIME]
- Report given to: [Receiving MD/RN name]

Special Considerations:
- [If high risk] Nephrology consultation needed for rhabdomyolysis management
- [If compartment syndrome suspected] Orthopedic/vascular surgery consult needed
- [If tourniquet used] Tourniquet applied at [TIME], location [specific], pulse check [absent], not removed
- [If geriatric] Close monitoring for volume overload - no signs of pulmonary edema throughout transport
- [If pediatric] Weight-based dosing calculations documented separately

Patient condition on arrival: [Stable/unstable, vitals, mental status]
