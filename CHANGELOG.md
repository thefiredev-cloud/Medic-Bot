## Upgrade Notes

### Upgrading to 2.0.0

**Breaking Changes**:
- Removed authentication requirement - all users have public access
- Removed JWT tokens and Azure AD integration
- Removed RBAC permissions system

**Migration Steps**:
1. Remove `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` from environment variables
2. Remove `AZURE_AD_*` environment variables
3. Add `RATE_LIMIT_CHAT_RPM` and `RATE_LIMIT_API_RPM` (optional, defaults to 20/60)
4. Update client code to remove authentication headers
5. Test rate limiting behavior in staging environment

**New Environment Variables**:
- `RATE_LIMIT_CHAT_RPM` - Chat endpoint rate limit (default: 20)
- `RATE_LIMIT_API_RPM` - API endpoint rate limit (default: 60)
- `ADMIN_IP_ALLOWLIST` - Comma-separated IP addresses for admin access
- `AUDIT_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Token for audit endpoint access
