## Overview

Comprehensive implementation of LA County Fire Department prehospital trauma triage criteria (PCM Reference 506) with an interactive, tablet-optimized decision tree UI providing paramedics with instant guidance on trauma center destination decisions.

---

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Backend Manager: `TraumaTriageManager` (lib/triage/trauma-triage.ts)

Implements comprehensive trauma assessment following OOP Manager Pattern per agent standards.

#### Key Features:
- **Single Responsibility**: Handles trauma triage assessment logic exclusively
- **Dependency Injection**: Ready for testing and mocking
- **Three-Tier Assessment**:
  - Section I: Physiologic Criteria (immediate trauma center indicators)
  - Section II: Anatomic Criteria (anatomical injury patterns)
  - Section III: Mechanism/Special Considerations (mechanism-based assessment)

#### Assessment Method:
```typescript
public assess(input: TraumaTriageInput): TraumaTriageResult
```

Returns structured result with:
- Destination (Trauma Center | Trauma Center Consideration | Non-Trauma Center)
- Urgency level (Code 3 | Code 2 | Code 1)
- Base Hospital contact requirement
- Specific criteria met
- Clinical recommendations
- Protocol citations

#### Input Types:
- **Physiologic Data**: Age, vitals (SBP, RR), cardiac arrest status
- **Anatomic Injuries**: Penetrating/blunt trauma patterns, CNS status, chest/abdomen/pelvis
- **Mechanism Factors**: Fall height, vehicle intrusion, pedestric/motorcycle, special populations

#### Medical Criteria Coverage:
- **Physiologic Section I** (3 criteria):
  - Hypotension (SBP < 90, or < 70 in infants)
  - Respiratory abnormalities (RR > 29, < 10, or requiring support)
  - Cardiac arrest with penetrating torso trauma
  
- **Anatomic Section II** (8 major categories):
  - Penetrating injuries (head/neck/torso/proximal extremities)
  - Head injuries (skull fracture, GCS ≤ 14, neurological deficits)
  - Torso/extremity (flail chest, vascular compromise, amputations, multiple fractures)
  - Abdomen/pelvis (tenderness, fractures, spinal injury, hemorrhage)

- **Mechanism Section III** (4 patterns):
  - Falls > 10 feet
  - Motor vehicle incidents (intrusion, ejection)
  - Pedestrian/motorcycle injuries
  - Special populations (pediatric, pregnancy, burns)

### 2. Enhanced UI Component: `DecisionTree` (app/components/decision-tree.tsx)

Tablet-optimized interactive decision tree with clinical context display.

#### Features:
- **Question Nodes**: Multiple-choice assessment questions
- **Result Nodes**: Destination decisions with full clinical context
- **Urgency Badges**: Color-coded codes (Red=Code 3, Amber=Code 2, Green=Code 1)
- **Criteria Display**: Lists specific criteria met with clinical explanations
- **Base Hospital Status**: Clear indication of notification requirements
- **Actions Section**: Paramedic-ready recommendations and treatment protocols

#### UI Enhancements:
- Large touch targets (68px buttons for gloved operation)
- High-contrast urgency badges with semantic colors
- Blue-bordered criteria section for visual distinction
- Structured actions list for quick clinical reference
- Breadcrumb path tracking for decision history

#### Props:
```typescript
interface DecisionTreeProps {
  nodes: TreeNode[];        // Decision tree structure
  startId: string;          // Initial node ID
  title: string;            // Display title
  showCriteria?: boolean;   // Toggle criteria display
}
```

Full trauma triage decision tree with 36 nodes covering all assessment pathways.

#### Tree Structure:

**Entry Point**: Patient alertness assessment
- Alert & communicative → Physiologic criteria assessment
- Altered/unconscious → Glasgow Coma Score check

**Section I: Physiologic Criteria** (5 nodes)
- Hypotension assessment → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- Respiratory abnormality → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- Cardiac arrest + penetrating → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- None → Continue to anatomy

**Section II: Anatomic Criteria** (6 nodes)
- Penetrating injury → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- Head/CNS injury → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- Torso/extremity injury → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- Abdomen/pelvis injury → Trauma Center (Code 3)
- None → Continue to mechanism

**Section III: Mechanism/Special Considerations** (5 nodes)
- Fall/motor vehicle → Trauma Center Consideration (Code 2)
- Pedestrian/motorcycle → Trauma Center Consideration (Code 2)
- Special populations → Trauma Center Consideration (Code 2)
- None → Non-Trauma Center (Code 1)

#### Node Specifications:

Each result node includes:
- **Destination**: Clear transport directive
- **Urgency**: Code 3/2/1 with color coding
- **BaseContact**: YES/CONSIDER/As needed
- **Criteria**: Specific LA County PCM Reference 506 criteria met
- **Actions**: Paramedic-ready treatment protocols

## Agent Patterns & Standards Applied

### Architecture Patterns

#### 1. Manager Pattern ✅
- `TraumaTriageManager` encapsulates all trauma assessment logic
- Single responsibility: Trauma triage determination
- Dependency injection ready for testing

#### 2. OOP-First Principles ✅
- Structured interfaces for input/output
- Private methods for internal logic separation
- Constants-based criteria thresholds

#### 3. Service-Level Organization ✅
- Manager resides in `lib/triage/` domain
- UI component in `app/components/`
- Clean separation of concerns

### Code Quality Standards

#### File Size Compliance ✅
- `trauma-triage.ts`: ~250 lines (well under 500 line limit)
- `decision-tree.tsx`: ~180 lines (modular and maintainable)
- `protocols/page.tsx`: ~280 lines (large but single responsibility)

#### Function Size Compliance ✅
- `assess()`: ~15 lines (single entry point)
- `checkPhysiologicCriteria()`: ~35 lines (max threshold)
- `checkAnatomicCriteria()`: ~40 lines (max threshold)
- Private helper methods all < 10 lines

#### Naming Conventions ✅
- Files: `kebab-case` (trauma-triage.ts, decision-tree.tsx)
- Classes: `PascalCase` (TraumaTriageManager)
- Methods: `camelCase` (checkPhysiologicCriteria)
- Types: `PascalCase` (TraumaTriageInput, TraumaTriageResult)

### Medical Accuracy

#### Protocol Compliance ✅
- All criteria directly from LA County PCM Reference 506
- Physiologic thresholds match official specification
- Anatomic injury patterns match documented criteria
- Mechanism patterns align with evidence-based protocols

#### Citations ✅
```typescript
citations: [
  "PCM Reference 506 - Trauma Triage",
  "MCG 1206 - Pediatric Considerations",
  "PCM Section II.A - Physiologic Criteria",
  "PCM Section II.B - Anatomic Criteria",
  "PCM Section II.C - Mechanism/Special Considerations"
]
```

#### Safety Considerations ✅
- Age-specific thresholds (infants vs. adults)
- Pediatric trauma lower thresholds
- Pregnancy special considerations
- Burn assessment criteria
- All contraindications included

## Clinical Workflow

### Paramedic Use Case: Trauma Assessment

1. **Initial Assessment** (10 seconds)
   - Select patient alertness status
   - GCS check if altered

2. **Physiologic Assessment** (30 seconds)
   - Check vitals (BP, RR)
   - Assess cardiac arrest status
   - Route to Trauma Center if ANY met

3. **Anatomic Assessment** (1-2 minutes)
   - Primary survey for injuries
   - Mechanism assessment
   - Route to Trauma Center if ANY met

4. **Mechanism Assessment** (30 seconds)
   - Evaluate fall height, vehicle involvement
   - Assess special populations
   - Determine consideration vs. standard ED

5. **Final Decision**
   - Clear destination with urgency
   - Base Hospital contact status
   - Clinical actions for transport

**Total Assessment**: 3-4 minutes from scene to destination decision
