## üìä METRICS TO TRACK

### Before Deployment
- [x] Original KB size: 10.62 MB
- [x] Initial load reduction: 98.9%
- [x] Essential chunks size: 117 KB
- [x] Number of chunks: 5
- [x] Total documents: 7,013

### After Deployment (TODO)
- [ ] Average page load time
- [ ] Time to Interactive (TTI)
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

## üîß VERIFICATION COMMANDS

### Verify chunks created
```bash
node scripts/verify-chunking.mjs
```

Expected output: ‚úì READY FOR PRODUCTION

### Test chunking
```bash
node scripts/test-chunked-kb.mjs
```

Expected output: 98.9% reduction

### Re-generate chunks (if needed)
```bash
node scripts/chunk-kb.mjs
```

### Check idb package
```bash
npm list idb
```

Expected: idb@^8.0.3

## üìù INTEGRATION EXAMPLE

### Before
```typescript
import { KnowledgeBaseManager } from '@/lib/storage/knowledge-base-manager';

const kb = await KnowledgeBaseManager.initialize(); // 10.62 MB
const results = await kb.search(query);
```

### After
```typescript
import { getChunkedKB } from '@/lib/storage/knowledge-base-chunked';

const kb = await getChunkedKB(); // ~117 KB
await kb.preloadEssentialChunks();
const results = await kb.search(query, ['Medication', 'Protocol']); // Optional category filter
```

## üöÄ ROLLOUT PLAN

## üìö DOCUMENTATION

All documentation created:
- ‚úì `docs/CHUNKED-KB-QUICKSTART.md` - Quick reference
- ‚úì `docs/notes/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.txt` - Complete summary
- ‚úì `docs/kb-chunking-implementation.md` - Full docs
- ‚úì `docs/chunking-architecture.md` - Architecture diagrams
- ‚úì `lib/storage/knowledge-base-chunked-example.ts` - Usage examples
- ‚úì `docs/CHUNKING-CHECKLIST.md` - This file

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTES

1. **Keep old KB during transition**
   - Don't delete `data/ems_kb_clean.json`
   - Old `KnowledgeBaseManager` can remain as fallback
   - Gradual migration is safe

2. **Service Worker cache name changed**
   - Old cache: `medic-bot-v1`
   - New cache: `medic-bot-v2-chunked`
   - Users will download new cache on first visit after deployment

3. **IndexedDB storage**
   - Database name: `medic-bot-kb`
   - Storage limit: ~15 MB (varies by browser)
   - Can be cleared manually if needed

4. **Browser compatibility**
   - Requires IndexedDB support (all modern browsers)
   - Service Worker support required for offline mode
   - Falls back gracefully on older browsers
