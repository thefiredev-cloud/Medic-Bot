# Medical Review Metadata Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Component:** Protocol 1210 Cardiac Arrest Clinical Decision Support Enhancement
**Status:** ✅ Implemented
**Scope:** Versioning and clinical content tracking for Phase A completion

---

## Overview

Medical review metadata has been added to the Protocol 1210 cardiac arrest enhancement to enable:

1. **Clinical accountability** – Track who approved clinical content and when
2. **Version control** – Semantic versioning for content modifications
3. **Regulatory compliance** – Maintain audit trail for PCM governance
4. **Quality assurance** – Formal medical director sign-off before production deployment

---

## Step 6: Medical Director Sign-Off Process

### Overview

**Phase A is NOT marked complete until medical director approval is obtained and metadata fields are updated.**

The sign-off process ensures:
- All clinical content is accurate and current
- Medication recommendations align with LA County PCM guidelines
- Evidence-based thresholds are properly supported
- No conflicts with existing protocols exist
- Protocol compliance is verified

### Pre-Review Checklist (QA Validation)

Before submitting to medical director, verify:

#### Clinical Content Validation

### Medical Director Review (Required Steps)

The **Medical Director/PCM Medical Control** must perform:

#### 1. Review Clinical Accuracy

Verify:
- **Medication Recommendations:**
  - Epinephrine timing (after 2nd shock for VF/VT, ASAP for PEA/asystole)
  - Amiodarone dosing (300mg initial, 150mg repeat, VF/VT only)
  - Sodium bicarbonate indications (hyperkalemia, TCA overdose, prolonged arrest)
  - Calcium chloride indications (hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, overdose)

- **ROSC Prediction Framework:**
  - Positive predictors align with literature (60-70% for witnessed, 40-50% for initial shockable)
  - Negative predictors appropriate (10-15% for asystole/PEA)
  - ETCO2 thresholds evidence-based
  - Age-based prognosis appropriate

- **H's & T's Reversible Causes:**
  - All 12 causes identified (6 H's, 6 T's)
  - Clues and treatments for each cause specified
  - Field-treatable vs transport-only differentiated

- **Termination Criteria:**

- [ ] Compression depth targets (2-2.4 inches for adults, 2 inches for children)
- [ ] ETCO2 threshold values (>20, 10-20, <10 mmHg decision points)
- [ ] All numeric values supported by evidence

#### 4. Approve or Request Modifications

**Option A: APPROVED** (No modifications needed)
- Set `medical_review_status: "approved"`
- Populate `medical_reviewer` with director name and credentials (e.g., "Dr. Jane Smith, MD, FACEP")
- Set `review_date` to ISO format date (e.g., "2025-10-[XX]")
- Keep `version` at "1.0.0" (no changes made)

## Version Control Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Format
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

**MAJOR** (X.0.0) – Breaking changes to clinical recommendations
- Example: Changing epinephrine timing from "after 2nd shock" to "ASAP"

**MINOR** (X.Y.0) – New features or sections added
- Example: Adding ECPR criteria section

**PATCH** (X.Y.Z) – Bug fixes or clarifications (no clinical change)
- Example: Correcting typo, clarifying wording

### Version Progression Example

1. Initial creation: `1.0.0` (2025-10-26)
   - `medical_review_status: "pending_approval"`

2. Medical director requests clarification on medication timing:
   - Review date: 2025-10-27
   - Update `version` → `1.0.1`
   - Update `last_modified` → `2025-10-27`
   - Set `medical_review_status: "approved_with_modifications"`
   - Populate `medical_reviewer` and `review_date`

3. If MINOR feature added later (new section):
   - `version` → `1.1.0`
   - Update `last_modified` to date of change

4. If major clinical change needed (unlikely for approved content):
   - `version` → `2.0.0`
   - Requires new medical director review
   - Set `medical_review_status: "pending_approval"` again

## Audit & Compliance

### Retention Requirements
- Medical review metadata retained **indefinitely**
- Version history maintained for all modifications
- All approvals preserved for compliance audit
- Medical reviewer credentials recorded

### Regulatory Compliance
The metadata fields support:
- **PCM Governance:** Medical director accountability documented
- **Regulatory Audit:** Complete version and review history maintained
- **Quality Assurance:** Evidence of clinical validation
- **Re-review Scheduling:** Can set annual review date based on `review_date`

### Annual Re-Review
For any approved content, consider:
- Annual review cycle (e.g., every October)
- Update `last_modified` if no changes needed
- Set new `review_date` if re-reviewed
- Document re-review in version history (e.g., "Re-reviewed and approved 2026-10-26, no changes")
