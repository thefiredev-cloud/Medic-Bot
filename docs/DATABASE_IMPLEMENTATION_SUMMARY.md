# Database Implementation Summary
## LA County Fire Medic-Bot - Supabase PostgreSQL Architecture

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Version**: 2.0.0
**Status**: Design Complete, Implementation Pending

---

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive database architecture analysis completed for the Medic-Bot application. The analysis reveals a **critical gap between designed and implemented database infrastructure**.

### Current State

**File-Based Storage**:
- Audit logs: JSON Lines files (`/logs/audit-{date}.jsonl`)
- Metrics: In-memory only (volatile)
- Rate limiting: In-memory only (not distributed)
- Knowledge base: Static JSON files (11MB)

**Database Status**:
- Supabase schema designed: YES (001_audit_logs.sql exists)
- Database connection established: NO
- Migrations executed: NO
- Tables created: NO

### Critical Findings

1. **No Persistent Storage**: Metrics and rate limit data lost on server restart
2. **Scalability Limitations**: File-based audit logs can't scale to 3,200 users
3. **Query Performance**: File scanning (O(n)) vs. indexed database queries (O(log n))
4. **HIPAA Compliance Risk**: 6-year audit log retention difficult with files
5. **No Analytics**: Can't perform aggregate queries on file-based data

## Database Schema Overview

### Core Tables (Designed)

#### 1. audit_logs (HIPAA Compliance)
```
Purpose: Immutable audit trail
Retention: 6 years (2,190 days)
Size: 9.1 GB/year (54.6 GB total)
Indexes: 8 (timestamp, user_id, action, metadata JSONB)
Triggers: Prevent UPDATE/DELETE (immutability)
```

**Key Features**:
- ENUM types for actions (16 types) and outcomes (3 types)
- JSONB metadata for flexible context storage
- GIN index for fast JSONB queries
- Helper functions: user audit trail, failed auth detection, summary stats
- Materialized view: `audit_stats` (daily aggregation)

#### 2. users (User Management)
```
Purpose: User accounts and profiles
Status: Designed but NOT implemented
Dependencies: authentication system (removed in v2.0)
```

**Schema**:
- UUID primary key
- Email (unique), badge number (unique)
- Role enum (paramedic | emt | medical_director | admin | guest)
- Station assignment
- Soft delete (preserve audit trail)

#### 3. sessions (Session Tracking)
```
Purpose: Multi-device session management
Dependencies: users table
Cleanup: Auto-delete expired sessions (trigger)
```

**Schema**:
- UUID primary key
- Foreign key to users (CASCADE delete)
- Fingerprint (SHA256 hash)
- Expiration timestamp (default 60 minutes)
- Last activity tracking

#### 4. metrics (Performance Monitoring)
```
Purpose: Persistent metrics storage
Replaces: In-memory MetricsRegistry
Granularity: Hourly buckets
Retention: 90 days
```

**Schema**:
- Counter metrics (total count)
- Histogram metrics (P50, P95, P99, min, max, avg)
- Unique constraint on (metric_name, date, hour)
- Views: metrics_daily, metrics_recent

### Missing Tables (Recommended)

#### 5. rate_limit_config
```
Purpose: Dynamic rate limit configuration
Current: Hardcoded in application code
Benefit: Modify limits without deployment
```

#### 6. rate_limit_violations
```
Purpose: Track abuse patterns and reputation
Current: In-memory only (lost on restart)
Benefit: Persistent ban list
```

#### 7. knowledge_base (Phase 3)
```
Purpose: Vector search and versioning
Current: Static JSON files
Benefit: Semantic search, real-time updates
Extension: pgvector (1536 dimensions)
```

#### 8. protocol_access (Analytics)
```
Purpose: Detailed protocol usage analytics
Current: Limited metadata in audit logs
Benefit: Top protocols, user feedback tracking
```

## Data Flow Analysis

### Current: File-Based Audit Logging
```
User Request → API Handler → AuditLogger.logEvent()
                              ├─ Console (dev only)
                              └─ File: logs/audit-{date}.jsonl
                                  • Append-only writes
                                  • No indexing
                                  • Full scan for queries
                                  • 2,190 files (6 years)
```

**Performance**: O(n) file scanning

### Recommended: Database-Based Audit Logging
```
User Request → API Handler → AuditLogger.logEvent()
                              ├─ File (backup)
                              └─ Database: audit_logs table
                                  • INSERT with prepared statements
                                  • 8 indexes (B-tree + GIN)
                                  • Query time: <50ms (30 days)
                                  • Materialized views
```

**Performance**: O(log n) indexed lookups

### Database Sizing

```
6-Year Projections (3,200 users, 450K queries/year):

audit_logs:    54.6 GB (9.1 GB/year × 6 years)
metrics:        0.043 GB (90-day rolling)
sessions:       0.0001 GB (active only)
violations:     0.012 GB (30-day rolling)
knowledge_base: 0.012 GB (Phase 3)
protocol_access: 0.135 GB/year

TOTAL: ~55 GB (6-year retention)

Recommended Plan:
- Supabase Pro: $25/mo (8 GB included)
- Overage: ~47 GB × $0.125/GB = $5.88/mo
- Total: ~$31/mo
```

---

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**audit_logs**:
- SELECT: Admins and medical directors only
- INSERT: Service role (system)
- UPDATE/DELETE: Blocked by triggers (immutability)

**users**:
- SELECT: Users see own data; admins see all
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Admins only

**sessions**:
- All operations: Users manage own sessions only

**metrics**:
- SELECT: All authenticated users
- INSERT/UPDATE: Service role only
- DELETE: Blocked (cleanup via trigger)

### Data Protection

**Encryption**:
- At rest: AES-256 (Supabase managed)
- In transit: TLS 1.3
- Sensitive fields: Consider encrypting JSONB metadata

**SQL Injection Prevention**:
- Parameterized queries only
- Supabase client handles escaping
- Zod validation before database calls

**PHI Handling**:
- ZERO patient data stored
- Audit logs capture query LENGTH, not TEXT
- Metadata sanitization (remove PHI fields)

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- ✓ Backward compatible (dual-write strategy)
- ✓ Supabase proven technology (used by 500K+ developers)
- ✓ Rollback capability (keep file-based backup)
- ✓ Gradual migration (table by table)

### Medium Risk
- ⚠ Data migration (6 years of logs) - Mitigated: incremental backfill
- ⚠ Cost overruns (if data grows faster) - Mitigated: archival to S3
- ⚠ Learning curve (team familiarity) - Mitigated: extensive documentation

### High Risk
- None identified

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Dual-Write Period**: Run file-based and database logging in parallel for 30 days
2. **Incremental Backfill**: Migrate historical logs in batches (avoid overwhelming database)
3. **Monitoring**: Track database size daily; alert at 80% capacity
4. **Backup Testing**: Monthly restore drills to verify backup integrity
5. **Performance Testing**: Load test with 500 concurrent users before cutover

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Execute migrations immediately (16-hour effort)
2. Migrate audit logs to database (20-hour effort)
3. Implement metrics persistence (12-hour effort)
4. Plan for Phase 3 vector search (knowledge base)

**Total Investment**: 82 hours + $31/mo
**Expected ROI**: Eliminates scalability bottleneck, enables advanced analytics, improves HIPAA compliance

**Decision Required**: Proceed with migration in next sprint (Week 1 start date: TBD)
