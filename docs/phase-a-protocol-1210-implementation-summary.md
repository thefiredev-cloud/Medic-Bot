## Files Created/Modified

### 1. **data/ems_kb_clean.json** (ENHANCED)
**Status:** ✅ Modified - Enhanced knowledge base entry added at line 26075

**Changes:**
- Added comprehensive Protocol 1210 clinical decision support entry (ID: `ems-protocol-1210-cardiac-arrest-clinical-enhancement`)
- 7,000+ lines of structured clinical guidance
- Integrated between existing cardiac arrest entries for optimal retrieval

**Medical Content Added:**

#### **Initial Rhythm Classification Decision Tree:**
- **SHOCKABLE (VF/VT):** Immediate defibrillation pathway
  - Coarse VF (>3mm amplitude) = better prognosis
  - Fine VF (<3mm amplitude) = consider epinephrine before shock
  - pVT must confirm pulseless (if pulse → TP 1213 Tachycardia)

- **NON-SHOCKABLE (PEA/Asystole):** CPR + medications pathway
  - Asystole: Confirm in multiple leads
  - PEA: ANY organized rhythm without pulse
  - Think H's & T's immediately

#### **ROSC Prediction Framework:**
**Strong Positive Predictors:**
- Witnessed arrest by bystander/EMS (60-70% ROSC rate)
- Bystander CPR <4 minutes (doubles survival)
- Initial shockable rhythm (VF/VT) = 40-50% ROSC
- ETCO2 >20 mmHg during CPR (good perfusion)

**Strong Negative Predictors:**
- Unwitnessed arrest with downtime >15 min
- Initial rhythm asystole/PEA = 10-15% ROSC
- ETCO2 <10 mmHg persistently (poor perfusion)
- Nursing home resident (5-10% survival)

**ETCO2 Prognostic Thresholds:**
- **>20 mmHg:** Good perfusion, continue aggressive resuscitation
- **10-20 mmHg:** Marginal perfusion, optimize CPR quality
- **<10 mmHg after 20 min:** Very poor prognosis, consider termination
- **Sudden rise >40 mmHg:** ROSC achieved!

#### **CPR Quality Metrics (AHA Guidelines):**
```
RATE: 100-120/min
  - Too slow (<100) = inadequate cardiac output
  - Too fast (>120) = inadequate filling time

DEPTH: 2.0-2.4 inches (5-6 cm) adults
  - Minimum 2 inches required
  - Maximum 2.4 inches (>2.4" = rib fractures, liver laceration)

RECOIL: Complete chest return between compressions
  - Leaning on chest = Impaired venous return
  - Reduces cardiac output by 20-30%

INTERRUPTIONS: <10 seconds
  - Only for rhythm checks, pulse checks, defibrillation, airway
  - Pre-charge defibrillator during CPR to minimize interruption

ROTATION: Switch compressors every 2 minutes
  - Fatigue decreases quality after 1-2 minutes
  - Switch during rhythm check to minimize interruption
```

#### **Medication Timing Optimization:**

**1. Epinephrine 1mg IV/IO - The Cornerstone Vasopressor**
```
WHEN TO GIVE:
  - VF/VT: After 2nd shock if no ROSC
  - PEA/Asystole: ASAP as soon as IV/IO access

REPEAT: Every 3-5 minutes (no maximum)

WHY THIS DRUG:
  - Alpha-1 agonist → Peripheral vasoconstriction
  - Increases coronary perfusion pressure
  - Increases cerebral perfusion
  - Improves coronary/cerebral blood flow during CPR

EVIDENCE:
  - Increases ROSC by 30-40%
  - Does NOT improve survival to discharge
  - STILL recommended by AHA

CRITICAL: STOP immediately upon ROSC
  (causes post-ROSC hypertension, may precipitate re-arrest)
```

**2. Amiodarone 300mg IV/IO - Antiarrhythmic for Refractory VF/VT**
```
WHEN TO GIVE:
  - VF/VT ONLY (never for PEA/asystole)
  - After 3rd shock if still in VF/VT

REPEAT: 150mg after 4th/5th shock
MAX TOTAL: 450mg (300mg + 150mg)

WHY THIS DRUG:
  - Prolongs refractory period of cardiac muscle
  - Prevents re-fibrillation after successful shock
  - Increases defibrillation success rate

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  - Post-ROSC hypotension (hold if SBP <90)
```

**3. Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq IV/IO - Limited Indications Only**
```
ONLY GIVE FOR:
  - Hyperkalemia (dialysis patient, peaked T-waves)
  - TCA overdose (wide QRS >0.12 sec)
  - Prolonged arrest >20 min with severe acidosis

WHY LIMITED USE:
  ❌ Does NOT improve ROSC in most arrests
  ❌ Worsens intracellular acidosis (paradoxical)
  ❌ Shifts oxyhemoglobin curve (decreases O2 release)
  ❌ Inactivates catecholamines in same IV line
  ✅ ONLY helpful for specific causes

CRITICAL: Flush IV line - do NOT mix with epinephrine
```

#### **Reversible Causes (H's & T's) Systematic Assessment:**

**The 6 H's (Metabolic/Physiologic):**
1. **Hypovolemia:** History bleeding → 2L NS bolus
2. **Hypoxia:** Respiratory distress before → Advanced airway, ETCO2
3. **H+ (Acidosis):** Prolonged arrest → CPR, ventilation (bicarb limited)
4. **Hypo/Hyperkalemia:** Dialysis patient/peaked T-waves → Ca, Bicarb, Albuterol
5. **Hypothermia:** Exposure, cold to touch → Rewarm, CPR until >32°C
6. **Hypoglycemia:** Diabetic, AMS before → D10/D50 IV

**The 6 T's (Mechanical/Toxicologic):**
1. **Tension Pneumothorax:** Unilateral absent breath sounds → Needle decompression
2. **Tamponade:** Penetrating trauma, JVD → Rapid transport (not field-treatable)
3. **Toxins:** Pill bottles, young patient → Specific antidotes (naloxone, bicarb, etc.)
4. **Thrombosis-Coronary (MI):** Chest pain before → Post-ROSC 12-lead for STEMI
5. **Thrombosis-Pulmonary (PE):** Recent surgery, sudden dyspnea → Consider fibrinolysis (rare)
6. **Trauma:** See TP 1244

#### **Post-ROSC Management (Critical First Hour):**
```
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (within 1 minute):
1. CONFIRM ROSC:
   - Palpable pulse (carotid/femoral)
   - ETCO2 sudden rise >40 mmHg
   - Blood pressure returns

2. STOP CPR and STOP Epinephrine immediately

3. AIRWAY: Confirm placement with ETCO2 waveform

VENTILATION TARGETS:
  - Rate: 10 breaths/min (NOT more - hyperventilation harmful)
  - Tidal volume: 6-7 mL/kg
  - SpO2: 94-98% (avoid 100% - hyperoxia harmful)
  - ETCO2: 35-40 mmHg (normal)

WHY AVOID HYPERVENTILATION:
  ❌ Increases intrathoracic pressure
  ❌ Decreases venous return → Decreases cardiac output
  ❌ Decreases cerebral blood flow (vasoconstriction from low CO2)
  ❌ May precipitate re-arrest

HEMODYNAMIC TARGETS:
  - SBP >90 mmHg (minimum)
  - MAP >65 mmHg (preferred)
  - If hypotensive: NS 1L bolus → Contact Base for vasopressors

12-LEAD ECG (Mandatory):
  - Obtain ASAP after ROSC
  - Look for STEMI (≥1mm ST elevation in 2 contiguous leads)
  - If STEMI → Cath lab activation per TP 1211

NEUROLOGICAL:
  - Most patients comatose (GCS 3-8) immediately - NORMAL
  - Do NOT assume poor prognosis
  - Seizures common (10-30%) → Midazolam 5mg IV/IM

TEMPERATURE:
  - Avoid hyperthermia (fever >38°C worsens outcomes)
  - Do NOT actively warm unless hypothermic
  - Field cooling NOT recommended (delays transport)
```

1. **Patient ≥18 years of age**
2. **Arrest NOT witnessed by EMS personnel**
3. **No shockable rhythm** identified at any time during resuscitation
4. **No ROSC** at any time during resuscitation
5. **No hypothermia**

23. Base Contact (hospital, physician, orders)
24. Reversible Causes Assessed (H's & T's, treatments attempted)

#### **Common Pitfalls & Corrections:**
- ❌ **Hyperventilating post-ROSC** → ✅ 10 breaths/min, SpO2 94-98%
- ❌ **Continuing epinephrine after ROSC** → ✅ STOP immediately
- ❌ **Delaying first epi in PEA/Asystole** → ✅ Give ASAP as soon as access
- ❌ **Excessive CPR interruptions** → ✅ <10 seconds, pre-charge defib
- ❌ **Inadequate compression depth** → ✅ 2-2.4 inches, use feedback device
- ❌ **Not switching compressors** → ✅ Rotate every 2 min at rhythm check
- ❌ **Giving amiodarone in PEA/Asystole** → ✅ VF/VT ONLY
- ❌ **Transporting during active CPR** → ✅ Work on scene until ROSC/termination
- ❌ **Not considering H's & T's in PEA** → ✅ Systematically address all
- ❌ **Terminating too early** → ✅ Minimum 20 min quality CPR
- ❌ **Defibrillating PEA or asystole** → ✅ Shock ONLY VF/VT
- ❌ **Not confirming airway with ETCO2** → ✅ ETCO2 waveform gold standard
- ❌ **Leaning on chest between compressions** → ✅ Complete recoil

#### **Quick Reference Card:**
```

## Sample Enhanced Response

**User Query:**
> "70 year old male found unresponsive by family. Pulseless, VF on monitor. Bystander CPR was started. We shocked him 3 times so far, gave 2 rounds of epi. ETCO2 is 15 mmHg. What should we do next?"

**System Response (Leveraging TP 1210 Enhancement):**

---

**Structured Intake:**
- 70y male
- Protocol Candidates (LA County):
  - Cardiac Arrest (TP 1210) - Score: 3

**Immediate Actions for Refractory VF:**

Based on TP 1210 Cardiac Arrest protocol, you've correctly given 2 doses of epinephrine. **Here's what to do next:**

**1. Continue High-Quality CPR:**
- Rate: 100-120/min, Depth: 2-2.4 inches
- Complete recoil between compressions
- Minimize interruptions to <10 seconds
- Switch compressors every 2 minutes

**2. Give Amiodarone NOW (After 3rd Shock):**
- **Amiodarone 300mg IV/IO push**
- Why: Prolongs cardiac refractory period, prevents re-fibrillation
- Only for VF/VT (never for PEA/asystole)
- Can give during CPR or immediately after next shock

**3. Continue Epinephrine Every 3-5 Minutes:**
- You've given 2 doses - give 3rd dose in ~3 minutes
- Continue every 3-5 min throughout resuscitation (no maximum)
- **STOP immediately** if ROSC achieved (causes hypertension)

**4. Rhythm Check Every 2 Minutes:**
- Pre-charge defibrillator during CPR
- If still VF/VT → Shock #4 (same or higher energy)
- Resume CPR immediately after shock

**5. ETCO2 Interpretation (Currently 15 mmHg):**
Your ETCO2 of **15 mmHg = Marginal perfusion**
- **Optimize CPR quality** (depth, rate, recoil)
- Good sign: >10 mmHg means perfusion present
- Goal: Trend upward >20 mmHg
- Watch for sudden rise >40 mmHg = **ROSC achieved!**

**6. Assess Reversible Causes (H's & T's):**
Consider treating:
- **Hypoxia:** Confirm advanced airway placement with ETCO2 waveform
- **Hyperkalemia:** Any history of dialysis or renal failure? If yes, consider Calcium Chloride 1g + Sodium Bicarbonate 50mEq
- **Thrombosis-Coronary (MI):** Likely given age - obtain 12-lead post-ROSC
- **Toxins:** Any medication history? Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers?

**7. If Second Amiodarone Needed:**
After 4th or 5th shock, if still refractory VF/VT:
- **Amiodarone 150mg IV/IO** (second dose)
- Maximum total: 450mg (300mg + 150mg)

**8. Good Prognostic Factors in Your Case:**
✓ **Witnessed** arrest (by family)
✓ **Bystander CPR** started
✓ **Initial shockable rhythm** (VF) = 40-50% ROSC rate
✓ **ETCO2 >10 mmHg** (perfusion present)
✓ **Age 70** (reasonable for ROSC)

Continue aggressive resuscitation!

**9. Post-ROSC Plan (When Achieved):**
- **STOP Epinephrine immediately**
- Ventilate **10 breaths/min** (avoid hyperventilation)
- Target SpO2 **94-98%** (not 100%)
- **12-Lead ECG** immediately (look for STEMI)
- If STEMI → Cath lab-capable hospital
- If hypotensive (SBP <90) → NS 1L bolus

**10. Termination Criteria:**
Do NOT terminate yet - you have positive prognostic factors. Consider termination only if ALL 6 criteria met per Ref 814:
1. Age ≥18 ✓
2. NOT witnessed by EMS ✓ (family witnessed)
3. NO shockable rhythm ever ✗ (You have VF)
4. NO ROSC ever (pending)
5. NO hypothermia (pending)
6. Asystole after 20 min CPR (pending)

Since you have VF (shockable), termination criteria NOT met. **Continue resuscitation.**

**Next Medications Timeline:**
- **NOW:** Amiodarone 300mg IV/IO (after 3rd shock)
- **~3 min:** Epinephrine 1mg IV/IO (3rd dose)
- **After 4th/5th shock if still VF/VT:** Amiodarone 150mg IV/IO (2nd dose)

**Documentation Reminder:**
Document exact times of:
- Each epinephrine dose
- Amiodarone doses
- Each shock delivered (energy, rhythm before/after)
- ETCO2 values and trend
- Reversible causes assessed

## Step 6: Medical Director Sign-Off & Phase A Completion

### Medical Review Metadata Requirements

All clinical content in Phase A Protocol 1210 enhancements must include the following metadata fields in the knowledge base JSON entries. These fields are now included in `temp-protocol-1210-enhancement.json`:

**Required Fields:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",                          // Semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
  "created_date": "2025-10-26",                // ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  "last_modified": "2025-10-26",               // ISO date format, updated on review
  "medical_review_status": "pending_approval", // pending_approval, approved, or approved_with_modifications
  "medical_reviewer": null,                    // Name of reviewing medical director (null → pending)
  "review_date": null,                         // ISO date of review (null → pending)

| `review_date` | Date of medical director review | ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) or `null` | Set by medical director on approval |

### Medical Director Sign-Off Process

**Phase A is NOT complete until ALL of the following are satisfied:**

#### ✅ **Before Medical Director Review:**
1. All clinical content passes internal validation:
   - [ ] TP 1210 protocol references are current and accurate

   - [ ] Medication doses match LA County PCM guidelines
   - [ ] CPR quality metrics align with AHA 2020 standards
   - [ ] ETCO2 thresholds are evidence-based

2. Quality assurance complete:
   - [ ] All 25 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
   - [ ] Knowledge base insertion validated (line 26075 in ems_kb_clean.json)
   - [ ] Search augmentation tested with cardiac arrest queries
   - [ ] ProtocolDocBuilder documentation methods verified

2. **Assess Protocol Compliance:**
   - [ ] Ensure content adheres to current LA County Prehospital Care Manual
   - [ ] Verify no conflicts with existing TP 1210, TP 1210-P, or related protocols
   - [ ] Check that pediatric considerations are addressed (link to TP 1210-P)
   - [ ] Validate trauma arrest handling (reference to TP 1244)

3. **Review Quality Metrics:**
   - [ ] CPR compression rate targets (100-120/min) approved
   - [ ] Compression depth targets (2-2.4 inches) approved
   - [ ] ETCO2 threshold values approved (>20, 10-20, <10 mmHg)
   - [ ] All numeric values have supporting evidence

4. **Approve or Request Modifications:**
   - [ ] **Option A - APPROVED:** Sign off with `medical_review_status: "approved"` and populate `medical_reviewer` and `review_date`
   - [ ] **Option B - APPROVED WITH MODIFICATIONS:** Update content per director feedback, then:
     - Set `medical_review_status: "approved_with_modifications"`
     - Update `version` to next patch version (e.g., "1.0.0" → "1.0.1")
     - Update `last_modified` to review date
     - Document modifications in CHANGELOG
     - Obtain re-approval from medical director

#### ✅ **After Medical Director Approval:**

Update the JSON metadata fields:
```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "created_date": "2025-10-26",
  "last_modified": "2025-10-26",                    // or review date if modifications made
  "medical_review_status": "approved",              // ← Medical director sets
  "medical_reviewer": "Dr. [Name], MD, FACEP",     // ← Medical director name/credentials
  "review_date": "2025-10-[XX]"                     // ← Date of sign-off

   - Ensure `data/ems_kb.json` mirrors `ems_kb_clean.json` approved content
   - Run KB chunking scripts if necessary
   - Update public KB files in `public/kb/`

3. **Mark Phase A Complete:**
   - [ ] Set implementation status in README: `Phase A: ✅ Complete (Approved by Medical Director)`
   - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with final approval date
   - [ ] Archive temp files (keep for audit trail)
   - [ ] Initiate Phase B (TP 1211 STEMI/ACS)

### Audit & Compliance

**All medical review metadata is maintained for:**
