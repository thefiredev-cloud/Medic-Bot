# Advanced Protocol Matching System

## Overview

The Medic-Bot protocol matching system uses a sophisticated multi-layered scoring algorithm to accurately identify the most relevant LA County PCM protocols for any patient presentation. This system combines weighted keyword matching, demographic awareness, vital signs integration, multi-symptom pattern detection, and negative keyword handling.

## Scoring Algorithm

### Layer 1: Weighted Keyword Matching

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/keyword-weights.ts`

Keywords are categorized into 4 tiers based on clinical significance:

| Tier | Weight | Examples | Use Case |
|------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | 10 points | stridor, apnea, pulseless, cardiac arrest, anaphylaxis, drowning, overdose | Life-threatening, highly specific symptoms |
| **High** | 5 points | chest pain, seizure, stroke, inhalation, gas, fumes, hoarse, crush injury, opioid | Important clinical indicators |
| **Moderate** | 2 points | SOB, dyspnea, wheezing, asthma, burns, fever, altered, cough | Relevant symptoms/conditions |
| **Low** | 0.5 points | patient, injury, pain, medical, emergency, trauma | General terms, low specificity |

**Benefits**:
- Critical symptoms like "stridor" (10 pts) dramatically outweigh generic terms like "patient" (0.5 pts)
- Multi-word phrases ("chest pain", "cardiac arrest") get proper weight, not double-counted
- ~120 keywords with evidence-based weights

### Layer 2: Negative Keyword Detection

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/advanced-scoring-engine.ts`

Detects when symptoms are explicitly denied and applies penalties:

**Negation Patterns**:
- "no [symptom]" → -200% of keyword weight
- "denies [symptom]" → -200% of keyword weight
- "without [symptom]" → -200% of keyword weight
- "negative for [symptom]" → -200% of keyword weight
- "absence of [symptom]" → -200% of keyword weight

**Example**:
```
Query: "70yo male, no chest pain, syncope"
Effect: 
- "chest pain" normally +5 points for cardiac protocols
- "no chest pain" applies -10 points penalty (200%)
- Net effect: Cardiac protocols downweighted, syncope protocols boosted
```

**Clinical Rationale**: Negative symptoms are crucial for differential diagnosis and prevent false positives.

### Layer 3: Severity Amplifiers

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/advanced-scoring-engine.ts`

Intensity modifiers amplify or reduce scores:

| Modifier Type | Terms | Multiplier |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **Severe** | severe, acute, sudden, crushing, critical, extreme, intense, excruciating | 1.4x (40% increase) |
| **Mild** | mild, minor, slight, minimal | 0.6x (40% decrease) |

**Example**:
```
Query: "severe crushing chest pain" 
Effect: Base cardiac score × 1.4 = significant boost

Query: "mild chest pain"
Effect: Base cardiac score × 0.6 = reduced priority
```

### Layer 4: Multi-Symptom Pattern Matching (Clinical Signatures)

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/protocol-signatures.ts`

Detects high-specificity symptom combinations and awards bonus points:

| Protocol | Signature | Required Terms | Bonus |
|----------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Cardiac (1211)** | Classic ACS | chest pain + diaphoresis | +15 pts |
| | STEMI | chest pain + ST elevation | +15 pts |
| **Stroke (1232)** | Cincinnati Scale | facial droop + arm weakness | +20 pts |
| | FAST Positive | facial droop + speech difficulty | +20 pts |
| **Anaphylaxis (1219)** | Classic Anaphylaxis | hives + airway swelling | +18 pts |
| | Severe Allergic | angioedema + respiratory distress | +18 pts |
| **Inhalation (1236)** | Airway Burn | stridor + hoarse | +18 pts |
| | Toxic Inhalation | inhaled + gas | +18 pts |
| **Sepsis (1204)** | Sepsis Criteria | fever + hypotension + tachycardia | +15 pts |
| **Shock (1207)** | Shock Presentation | hypotension + tachycardia | +15 pts |
| **Crush (1242)** | Crush Syndrome | entrapment + crush | +18 pts |

**Example**:
```
Query: "chest pain with diaphoresis and nausea, jaw pain radiating to left arm"
Effect:
- Base keywords: chest pain (5), diaphoresis (2), nausea (2), jaw pain (2) = 11 pts
- ACS Signature: +15 pts
- Total: 26 pts for Protocol 1211 (strong match)
```

### Layer 5: Demographic Modifiers

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/demographic-modifiers.ts`

Age, sex, and pregnancy status modify protocol likelihood based on epidemiology:

| Protocol Category | Demographic Rule | Multiplier | Rationale |
|-------------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Pediatric (-P)** | Age ≥18 | 0.05x | Near-elimination for adults |
| **Pediatric (-P)** | Age <18 | 1.5x | Boost for children |
| **OB/GYN (1215-1218)** | Male | 0x | Impossible |
| **OB/GYN (1215-1218)** | Female + Pregnant | 1.8x | Strong boost |
| **Cardiac (1211)** | Male + Age >40 | 1.3x | Increased risk |
| **Cardiac (1211)** | Age >60 | 1.4x | Significantly higher risk |
| **Stroke (1232)** | Age >60 | 1.3x | Age is primary risk factor |
| **Stroke (1232)** | Age <40 | 0.6x | Less common in young |
| **Sepsis (1204)** | Age <2 or >65 | 1.4x | Higher risk extremes |
| **Syncope (1233)** | Age >65 | 1.2x | More concerning in elderly |

**Example**:
```
Query: "70 year old male with chest pain"
Effect:
- Base score for cardiac: 15 pts
- Age >60 modifier: ×1.4 = 21 pts
- Male + Age >40 modifier: ×1.3 = 27.3 pts
- Final: Very strong match for Protocol 1211
```

### Layer 6: Vital Signs Integration

**File**: `lib/triage/scoring/advanced-scoring-engine.ts`

Abnormal vitals boost relevant protocols:

| Vital Sign | Threshold | Affected Protocols | Multiplier |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| **Hypotension** | SBP <90 | Shock (1207), Sepsis (1204), Cardiac (1211) | 1.5x |
| **Hypoxia** | SpO2 <90 | Respiratory (1237, 1236, 1234, 1214) | 1.4x |
| **Tachycardia** | HR >120 | Tachycardia (1213), Shock (1207), Sepsis (1204), Cardiac (1211) | 1.3x |
| **Bradycardia** | HR <50 | Bradycardia (1212) | 1.6x |
| **Fever** | >100.4°F or >38°C | Sepsis (1204) | 1.4x |
| **Tachypnea** | RR >24 | Respiratory (1237, 1236, 1234) | 1.2x |
| **Hypoglycemia** | Glucose <60 | Diabetic (1203) | 1.8x |

**Example**:
```
Query: "infection, temp 103°F, BP 88/55, HR 130, altered mental status"
Effect:
- Base score for sepsis: 12 pts
- Fever >100.4°F modifier: ×1.4 = 16.8 pts
- Hypotension <90 modifier: ×1.5 = 25.2 pts
- Tachycardia >120 modifier: ×1.3 = 32.8 pts
- Sepsis signature bonus: +15 pts = 47.8 pts total
- Final: Extremely strong match for Protocol 1204 (Sepsis)
```

## Complete Scoring Formula

```
Final Score = (
  (Base Weighted Keywords + Multi-Symptom Bonus + Negative Penalties)
  × Severity Amplifier
  × Demographic Modifier
  × Vital Signs Modifier
)
```

- ✅ Demographic-based protocol selection (pediatric vs adult, OB/GYN)
- ✅ Multi-factorial decision support (symptoms + vitals + demographics)
- ✅ Negative symptom handling for differential diagnosis

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements (not currently implemented):
1. **Fuzzy matching** for typos ("stidor" → "stridor")
2. **Temporal keywords** ("sudden onset" vs "gradual")
3. **Medication/allergy interaction scoring** (if taking beta-blocker → affects bradycardia interpretation)
4. **Protocol co-occurrence patterns** (trauma + burns often concurrent)
5. **Machine learning calibration** based on real-world usage patterns

## Usage

The advanced scoring is automatically enabled when full triage context is available:

```typescript
// Automatically uses advanced scoring
const result = triageInput("45yo male, stridor, inhaled gas");
// result.matchedProtocols[0].tp_code === "1236" ✓
```

No configuration required - the system intelligently applies all scoring layers based on available data.
