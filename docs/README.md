This directory houses project documentation and working notes.

- Core docs live directly under `docs/` (architecture, design, deployment).
- Session notes, reports, and temporary checklists are grouped under `docs/notes/`.

Contribute updates by keeping files small and focused. Prefer adding a new
short page over expanding a long one.
