# Enhanced IP-Based Rate Limiting Implementation

## Overview
Implemented enhanced rate limiting with request fingerprinting and IP reputation tracking for improved public access security. This addresses the critical need for rate limiting in a system without user authentication.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Enhanced Rate Limiter (`lib/security/rate-limit.ts`)

#### Key Features
- **Request Fingerprinting**: Generates unique fingerprints based on multiple request headers (IP, User-Agent, Accept-Language, Accept-Encoding)
- **Reputation Tracking**: Maintains a reputation score (0-100) for each fingerprint
- **Automatic Banning**: Blocks fingerprints with reputation scores below 10
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Periodically removes stale records (every 5 minutes)

#### Rate Limits (Reduced for Public Access)
```typescript
CHAT:   20 requests/minute  (reduced from 30)
API:    60 requests/minute  (reduced from 100)
DOSING: 30 requests/minute
AUTH:   5 requests/15 minutes
PHI:    50 requests/minute
GLOBAL: 500 requests/15 minutes
```

#### Reputation System
- **Good Behavior**: Each successful request within limits increases reputation by +1 (capped at 100)
- **Bad Behavior**: Each rate limit violation decreases reputation by -10
- **Ban Threshold**: Reputation < 10 results in automatic ban (403 Forbidden)
- **Low Reputation Warning**: Reputation < 50 triggers warning logs

#### Fingerprinting Algorithm
```typescript
SHA256(IP + User-Agent + Accept-Language + Accept-Encoding)[0:16]
```
This provides better identification than IP alone, especially for users behind NAT or proxies.

### 2. API Handler Integration (`lib/api/handler.ts`)

#### Enhanced Logic
1. Generate fingerprint for incoming request
2. Check if fingerprint is banned (reputation < 10)
   - If banned: Return 403 Forbidden
3. Check rate limit for fingerprint
   - If exceeded: Return 429 Too Many Requests with headers
4. Add rate limit headers to all responses (success and failure)

#### Headers Added
```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 20
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 15
X-RateLimit-Reset: 2025-10-08T20:30:00.000Z
Retry-After: 45
```

### 3. Monitoring Endpoint (`app/api/admin/rate-limits/route.ts`)

#### Purpose
Provides real-time statistics about rate limiting state for monitoring and debugging.

#### Access
- **Development only**: Returns 403 in production for security
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/admin/rate-limits`

#### Response Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-08T20:30:00.000Z",
  "environment": "development",
  "stats": {
    "activeFingerprints": 42,
    "reputationTracked": 38,
    "lowReputationCount": 5,
    "bannedCount": 2
  },
  "health": {
    "status": "healthy",
    "message": "Rate limiting operating normally"
  }
}
```

### 4. Testing

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/security/rate-limit.test.ts`)
- **16 tests, all passing**
- Coverage includes:
  - Fingerprint generation consistency
  - Rate limit enforcement
  - Reputation tracking
  - Automatic banning
  - Header generation
  - Statistics reporting
  - Cleanup functionality

#### Integration Test Script (`scripts/test-rate-limiting.mjs`)
Node.js script to test rate limiting in a running application:
- Makes rapid requests to trigger limits
- Verifies rate limit headers
- Tests different fingerprints (user agents)
- Checks monitoring endpoint

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start dev server first
npm run dev

# In another terminal
node scripts/test-rate-limiting.mjs
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. Better Client Identification
- Fingerprinting provides more accurate tracking than IP alone
- Reduces false positives from shared IPs (NAT, corporate proxies)
- Makes abuse harder (attacker must change multiple headers)

### 2. Reputation-Based Protection
- Gradual degradation for suspicious behavior
- Automatic recovery for legitimate users
- Clear warnings for monitoring teams

### 3. DDoS Mitigation
- Reduced rate limits prevent resource exhaustion
- Automatic banning stops persistent attackers
- Per-endpoint limits protect specific resources

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Real-time statistics for security teams
- Low reputation warnings for proactive response
- Health status for automated alerting

## Known Limitations

### 1. In-Memory Storage
- **Issue**: State is not shared across multiple server instances
- **Impact**: Users could exceed limits by targeting different servers
- **Solution**: Migrate to Redis for production deployment

### 2. Fingerprint Evasion
- **Issue**: Determined attacker can change headers to generate new fingerprints
- **Mitigation**: Combine with other security measures (CAPTCHA, WAF)

### 3. Browser Fingerprinting Limits
- **Issue**: Browser extensions can modify headers
- **Impact**: Legitimate users might be affected
- **Mitigation**: Reputation system allows gradual recovery

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Migrate to Redis for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Configure rate limits based on actual traffic patterns
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts for high ban rates
- [ ] Implement CAPTCHA fallback for banned users
- [ ] Add rate limit bypass for verified API keys
- [ ] Configure CDN/WAF rate limiting as first layer
- [ ] Test failover behavior under Redis outage
- [ ] Document incident response for false positive bans

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Key Metrics
1. **Ban Rate**: Should be < 0.1% of total requests
2. **Low Reputation Rate**: Should be < 1% of fingerprints
3. **Rate Limit Hit Rate**: Should be < 5% of requests

### Alert Thresholds
- **Warning**: Ban rate > 0.5%
- **Critical**: Ban rate > 2%
- **Warning**: Low reputation rate > 5%
- **Critical**: Low reputation rate > 10%

### Dashboards
1. Real-time rate limit stats (refresh every 30s)
2. Reputation score distribution histogram
3. Top blocked fingerprints (for abuse pattern analysis)
4. Rate limit violations by endpoint

## Files Modified

1. `lib/security/rate-limit.ts` - Enhanced rate limiter with fingerprinting
2. `lib/api/handler.ts` - Integrated fingerprinting and reputation checks
3. `app/api/admin/rate-limits/route.ts` - NEW: Monitoring endpoint
4. `tests/unit/security/rate-limit.test.ts` - NEW: Comprehensive unit tests
5. `scripts/test-rate-limiting.mjs` - NEW: Integration test script
6. `docs/enhanced-rate-limiting.md` - NEW: This documentation

## Bug Fixes

### Issue: Reputation Score 0 Treated as Falsy
**Problem**: `getReputation(key)` used `||` operator, which treated score of 0 as falsy and returned default value of 100.

**Fix**: Changed to nullish coalescing operator (`??`):
```typescript
// Before
return this.reputation.get(key)?.score || 100;

// After
return this.reputation.get(key)?.score ?? 100;
```

This ensures that a score of 0 is correctly returned instead of defaulting to 100.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Testing**: Load test with realistic traffic patterns
2. **Redis Integration**: Implement distributed rate limiting for production
3. **CAPTCHA Integration**: Add CAPTCHA fallback for high-reputation violations
4. **Analytics Integration**: Track rate limiting metrics in Supabase
5. **Documentation**: Add API documentation for rate limit headers
